Programming Basics
========================================================
- We've seen code like
```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r, eval=F}
mpg = read_csv('data/mpg.csv')
```
- We know this reads a .csv from a file and creates something called a "data frame" 
- We've been using this data frame in code like
```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(mpg) + geom_bar(aes(x=manufacturer))
```
- But what does this syntax really mean? Is it useful outside of making plots?

Assignment
===
type: section

Assignment
========================================================

- To do complex computations, we need to be able to give
names to things.
```{r, eval=F}
mpg = read_csv('data/mpg.csv')
```
- This code *assigns* the result of running `read_csv('data/mpg.csv')` to the name `mpg`
- You can do this with any values and/or functions
```{r}
x = (13 + 7)/2
```
- R prints no result from this assignment, but what you entered
causes a side effect: R has stored the association between
x and the result of this expression (look at the Environment pane.)

Using the value of a variable
========================================================
```{r}
x
x / 5
```
- When R sees the name of a variable, it uses the stored value of
that variable in the calculation.
- Here R uses the value of x, which is 10.
- We can break complex calculations into named parts. This is a
simple, but very useful kind of abstraction.

Two ways to assign
========================================================
In R, there are (unfortunately) two assignment operators. They have
subtly different meanings (more details later).
- `<-` requires that you type two characters. Don't put a
space between `<` and `-`. (What would happen?)
- RStudio hint: Use "`Option -`" (Mac) or "`Alt -`" (PC)
to type this using one key combination.
- `=` is easier to type.
- You will see both used throughout R and user code.

```{r}
x <- 10
x
x = 20
x
```

Assignment has no undo
========================================================
```{r}
x <- 10
x
x <- x + 1
x
```
- If you assign to a name with an existing value, that value is overwritten.
- There is no way to undo an assignment, so be careful in reusing variable names.

Naming variables
========================================================
- It is important to pick meaningful variable names.
- Names can be too short, so don't use `x` and `y` everywhere.
- Names can be too long (`Main.database.first.object.header.length`).
- Avoid silly names.
- Pick names that will make sense to someone else (including the
person you will be in six months).
- ADVANCED: See `?make.names` for the complete rules on
what can be a name.

Case matters for names in R
========================================================
```{r, eval=F}
a <- 1
A # this causes an error because A does not have a value
```
```
Error: object 'A' not found
```
- R cares about upper and lower case in names.
- We also see that some error messages in R are a bit obscure.

More about naming
========================================================
There are different conventions for constructing compound names. Warning:
disputes over the right way to do this can get heated.
```{r, prompt=FALSE,eval=FALSE,tidy=FALSE}
stringlength
string.length
StringLength
stringLength
string_length (underbar)
string-length (hyphen)
```
- To be consistent with the packages we will use, I recommend snake_case where you separate lowercase words with _
- Note that R itself uses several of these conventions.
- One of these won't work. Which one and why?

R saves some names for itself
========================================================
```{r eval=FALSE}
for <- 7 # this causes an error
```
- `for` is a reserved word in R. (It is used in loop control.)
- ADVANCED: see `?Reserved` for the complete rules.

Exercise: birth year
===
type: prompt
incremental: true

- Make a variable that represents the age you will be at the end of this year
- Make a variable that represents the current year
- Use them to compute the year of your birth and save that as a variable
- Print the value of that variable

```{r}
my_age_end_of_year = 30
this_year = 2020
my_birth_year = this_year - my_age_end_of_year
my_birth_year
```

Functions
========================================================
type: section

Calling built-in functions
========================================================
- To call a function, type the function name, then the argument or
arguments in parentheses. (Use a comma to separate the arguments, if
                           more than one.)
```{r}
sqrt(2)
```


Functions and variable assignment
========================================================
```{r}
x = 4
sqrt(x)
x
y = sqrt(x)
y
x = 10
y
```
- What do you observe?

Functions and variable assignment
========================================================
- functions generally do not affect the variables you pass to them (`x` remains the same after `sqrt(x)`)
- The results of a function call will simply be printed out if you do not save the result to a variable
- Saving the result to a variable lets you use it later, like any other variable you define manually
- Once a variable has been assigned (`y`), it keeps its value until updated, even if you change other variables (`x`) that went into the original assignment of that variable

Arguments by position
========================================================
- Arguments can be specified by position, with one supplied
argument for each name in the function parameter list, and in the
same order
```{r, tidy=F}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(displ, hwy))
```

***

- Sometimes, arguments can be supplied by name using the syntax,
variable `=` value.
- When using names, the order of the named arguments
does not matter.
```{r, tidy=F}
ggplot(data=mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping=aes(y=hwy, x=displ))
```

Exercise
========================================================
incremental: true
type: prompt

What is wrong with this code?

```{r, tidy=F}
ggplot(dta=mpg) + 
  geom_point(maps=aes(y=hwy, x=displ))
```

- If you use names, they have to be spelled correctly

Exercise
========================================================
incremental: true
type: prompt

Why is this plot on its side relative to the format we've been looking at?

```{r, tidy=F}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(hwy, displ))
```

- If you use positional arguments, they have to be in the right order

Finding the names of a function's arguments
========================================================
incremental: true
type: prompt

`read_csv()` takes a number of optional named arguments. What are some of them?


Calling functions from a package
============================================================
- Sometimes packages introduce name conflicts, which is when the pacakge loads a function that is named the same thing as a function that's already in the environment
- Typically, the package being loaded will take precedence over what is already loaded.
- For instance:
```{r, eval=F, tidy=F}
?filter # returns documentation for a function called filter in the stats package
library(dplyr)
?filter # now returns documentation for a function called filter in the dplyr package!
```
- You can tell R which function you want by specifying the package name and then `::` before the function name
```{r, eval=F, tidy=F}
?stats::filter
?dplyr::filter
```
- This also works when calling the function in your code

Vectors
========================================================
type: section


Repetitive calculations
========================================================
```{r}
x1 = 1
x2 = 2
x3 = 3
```

Let's say I have these variables and I want to add 1 to all of them and save the result.

```{r}
y1 = 1 + x1
y2 = 2 + x2
y3 = 3 + x3
```

This does the trick but it's a lot of copy-paste

Vectors
====
- Vectors solve the problem
```{r}
x = c(1,2,3)
y = x + 1
y
```
- A vector is a one-dimensional sequence of zero or more values
- Vectors are created by wrapping the values separated by commas with the `c(` `)` function, which is short for "combine"
- Many R functions and operators (like `+`) automatically work with
multi-element vector arguments.

Ranges
===
```{r}
1:50
```
- The colon `:` is a handy shortcut to create a vector that is
a sequence of integers from the first number to the second number
(inclusive).
- Long vectors wrap around. (Your screen may have a different width than what is shown here.)
- Look at the `[ ]` notation. The second output line starts
with 23, which is the 24^th element of the vector.
- This notation will help you figure out where you are in a long vector.

Elementwise operations on a vector
========================================================
- This multiplies each element of `1:10` by the corresponding element of `1:10`, that is, it squares each element.
```{r}
(1:10)*(1:10)
```
- Equivalently, we could use exponentiation:
```{r}
(1:10)^2
```
- Many basic R functions operate on multi-element vectors as
easily as on vectors containing a single number.
```{r}
sqrt(0:10)
```

Some functions operate on vectors and give back a single number
========================================================
```{r}
shoesize <- c(9, 12, 6, 10, 10, 16, 8, 4)
shoesize
sum(shoesize)
sum(shoesize)/length(shoesize)
mean(shoesize)
```

Vectors of other types
===
- text data in R is called a "string"
```{r}
my_string = "hello"
```
- when using data that is text in R, you have to refer to it using quotation marks (why?)
```{r, eval=F}
my_string = hello # what does this code do?
```
- you can have a vector of strings, and functions can operate on these too:
```{r}
words = c("hello", "how", "are", "you", "?")
paste(words, collapse=" ")
```

Exercise: subtract the mean
========================================================
incremental: true
type: prompt 

```{r}
x = c(7, 3, 1, 9)
```
- Subtract the mean of `x` from `x`, and then `sum` the result.

```{r}
x = c(7, 3, 1, 9)
mean(x)
x - mean(x)
sum(x - mean(x)) # answer in one expression
```

Exercise: a vector of variables
===
type: prompt
incremental: true

- Predict the output of the following code:
```{r, eval=F}
a = 1
b = 2
x = c(a,b)

a = 3
print(x)
```

***

```{r}
a = 1
b = 2
x = c(a,b)

a = 3
print(x)
```

Data Frames
===
type:section

Making data frames
========================================================
- use `tibble()` to make your own data frames from scratch in R
```{r}
my_data = tibble( 
  mrn = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
  age = c(33, 48, 8, 29)
)
my_data
```

Data frame properties
========================================================
- `dim()` gives the dimensions of the data frame. `ncol()` and `nrow()` give you the number of columns and the number of rows, respectively.
```{r}
dim(my_data)
ncol(my_data)
nrow(my_data)
```

- `names()` gives you the names of the columns (a vector)
```{r}
names(my_data)
```

Data frame properties
========================================================
- `glimpse()` shows you a lot of information, `head()` returns the first `n` rows
```{r}
glimpse(my_data)
head(my_data, n=2)
```

Scripts
============================================================
type: section

Using the script pane
============================================================
- Writing a series of expressions in the console rapidly gets
messy and confusing.
- The console window gets reset when you restart RStudio.
- It is better (and easier) to write expressions and functions
in the script pane (upper left), building up your analysis.
- There, you can enter expressions, evaluate them, and save the
contents to a .R file for later use.
- Look at the RStudio ``Code'' menu for some useful keyboard
commands.

Script pane example
============================================================
- Create a script pane: File > New File > R Script
- Put your cursor in the script pane.
- Type: `factorial(1:10)`
- Then hit `Command-RETURN` (Mac), or `Ctrl-ENTER` (Windows).
- That line is copied to the console pane and evaluated.
- You can save the script to a file.
- Explore the RStudio Code menu for other commands.

Adding comments
========================================================
```{r}
## This is a comment
1 + 2 # add some numbers
```
- Use a `#` to start a comment.
- A comment extends to the end of the
line and is ignored by R.

Exercise: Plotting a parabola
===
type: prompt
incremental: true

Write an R script that starts with:

```{r}
A = 1
B = 2
C = 3
```

In the rest of the script, do the following:

- generate an evenly-spaced sequence of 100 values between -5 and 5 (find an R function that does this). Call this `x`
- generate the corresponding y-values `y` by computing the formula $y = Ax^2 + Bx + C$
- create a data frame with `x` and `y` as columns
- use ggplot to create a line plot of `x` vs `y`

Run your script to see the generated plot. Try changing the values of `A`, `B`, and `C` at the top of the script to see how the plot changes.

***

```{r}
x = seq(-5, 5, length.out=100)
y = A*x^2 + B*x + C
df = tibble(x=x, y=y)
ggplot(df) + geom_line(aes(x,y))
```
